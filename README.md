# I Am a Strange Loop: A Journey into Self-Reference

Douglas Hofstadter's 2007 masterpiece, _**I Am a Strange Loop**_, dives into the intricate world of [strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop "Strange loop"), a concept he originally explored in his 1979 groundbreaking book _[Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach "Gödel, Escher, Bach")_. This book is more than a mere exploration; it's a philosophical odyssey into the heart of self-perception.

> "In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference."

## Purpose of This Page

This space is a personal anthology of self-referencing marvels observed in various facets of my life. It's a collection born out of sheer curiosity, a testament to my fascination with strange loops and their mysterious presence in the universe. While it may seem like a quirky collection without practical application, it's a celebration of the enigmatic beauty found in the complexities of self-reference and introspection.

## Self-referencing marvels

### EBNF 

[EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) **extended Backus–Naur form** (**EBNF**) is a family of [metasyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax "Metasyntax") notations. EBNF can be described using EBNF.

### Quine

A [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") which takes no input and produces a copy of its own [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the [computability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory "Computability theory") and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") literature are "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

### Drawing Hands

_**Drawing Hands**_ is a [lithograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithograph "Lithograph") by the [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands "Netherlands") artist [M. C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher "M. C. Escher") first printed in January 1948. It depicts a sheet of paper, out of which two hands rise, in the [paradoxical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox "Paradox") act of drawing one another into existence. This is one of the most obvious examples of Escher's common use of paradox.

### Sierpinski Triangle

The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal and an attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. It's named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, who described it in 1915, although it had been known to Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano as early as 1890.

At each iteration, the emerging pattern remains consistent: an exact smaller-scale replica of the original. When you zoom in on any of the corner triangles, you will find an identical version of the initial triangle. This property holds true at any level of magnification. Each smaller triangle is an exact miniature copy of the whole, embodying the concept of exact self-similarity.
