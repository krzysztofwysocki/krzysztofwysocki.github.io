# I Am a Strange Loop: A Journey into Self-Reference

Douglas Hofstadter's 2007 masterpiece, _**I Am a Strange Loop**_, dives into the intricate world of [strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop "Strange loop"), a concept he originally explored in his 1979 groundbreaking book _[Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach "Gödel, Escher, Bach")_. This book is more than a mere exploration; it's a philosophical odyssey into the heart of self-perception.

> "In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference."
